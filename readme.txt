Enables a beer post type and beer list shortcode.

== Description ==

This plugin allows home brewers, professional breweries, and beer afficianadoes to enter individual beer, beer categories, and beer details. It provides a shortcode that will allow for display management.

**Features include:**

* Easily categorize and group your beer with a configurable shortcode.
* Enter details for your beer that include: ABV, IBU, OG, FG, SRM/Color, Malts, Hops, and Yeast.

**New features**
We want to improve the Beer Directory plugin based on your feedback! Please let us know via the plugin's support tab and [subscribe to our mailing list](http://rescuethemes.us6.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=e996b9d9a5&id=a41af7345e) to get notified of new developments.

== Installation ==

1. Install Beer Directory either via the WordPress.org plugin directory, or by uploading the files to your server.
2. After activating the plugin, a new menu item named "Beer" will be added to your WordPress dashboard. Select the "Add Beer" menu and start inputing your individual beer.
3. To display your beer, paste the beer shortcode anywhere you'd like to display them and adjust the shortcode attributes to your liking:

`[beer count="5" orderby="title" category="american-ale" id="34"]`

4. That's it. Your beer is ready for the world!
